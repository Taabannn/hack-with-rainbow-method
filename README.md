# hack-with-rainbow-method
This is a hack project using the Rainbow method. There is a source csv file containing people's names and their hashed passwords using sha256 algorithm and my goal is to find the original passwords which are four-digit numbers (1000-9999). 

. Firstly, create an "input.csv" file contains "username,hashed password" in each row like below:
       `danial,99b057c8e3461b97f8d6c461338cf664bc84706b9cc2812daaebf210ea1b9974 <br>
